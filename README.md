# Silent Hill Randomizer #
This is an enemy randomizer for Silent Hill 2 and 3.
The code is awful, it was whiped up in an afternoon for a stream.
It is currently not being worked on, but if you have questions or wish to contribute, ask away!

## Usage ##
Just run the the latest exe from the releases and follow the instructions in the program. Make sure you have the .NET framework installed (latest version will do).
Expect crashes! I have not done any extensive QA or debugging on this.

## Other ##

It is a tool made for the Unity game engine to help reverse engineer Silent Hill games.
